### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for SC Kill Monitor.
Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community to understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find that you don't need to create one.
When you're creating a bug report, [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).
Fill out [the required template](.gitlab/issue_templates/Bug.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

- **Check the FAQ** for a list of common questions and problems.
- **Perform a cursory search** to see if the problem has already been reported.
If it has, **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as Issues. Provide the following information by filling in [the template](.gitlab/issue_templates/Bug.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as much detail as possible.
For example, start by explaining how you started the software. When listing steps, **don't only say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.**
Include links to files, other projects, or copy-pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
If you're providing snippets in the issue, use proper Markdown code formatting.
